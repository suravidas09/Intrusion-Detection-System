The aim of the project is to build a network intrusion detection system to classify between normal connections and intrusions or 'attacks'.

The dataset can be downloaded from the following link
http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html

After preprocessing the data few Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms were used to make predictions.

Following that, I tuned the model and compared the various results to arrive at a final result.
